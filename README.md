# Stormy
Weather data from the Dark Sky API is displayed using OkHttp. The temperature, percipitation, humidity, icon and weather summary are updated every minute. Tap on any city button for current weather details from that city. The theme will change depending on the weather of the selected city. If it's night or foggy, a dark theme will be displayed. If it's clear or sunny, a light theme will be displayed. If's it cloudy or rainy, a stormy theme will be displayed. There is also a link to learn more about Dark Sky at the bottom of the screen. Error messages will be displayed if there is an issue with the network connection or the API call. Created with the help of Treehouse.
